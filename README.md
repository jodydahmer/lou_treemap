# lou_treemap
Github for Louisville Tree Map

Problem:

While tree data has been used before for Louisville planning, the exact species and makeup of each neighborhood has been vague at best. This causes monocultures and neighborhoods that are ill prepared for invasive beetles (Ash tree), foreign pathogens and fungi (Elm tree / Chestnut) , or rising temperatures. We need to find the best way to create a API for users as well as interested companies to easily map their data. 

Objectives 

Find and map tree species across Jefferson County / Louisville Metro area
  *NOTE* We will be starting with a prototype of 1 - 2 streets to test.
  
 Use map to overlap onto existing tree data based on Louisville Urban Tree Canopy Assessment

 Create scalable prototype other cities can use to map their tree data
